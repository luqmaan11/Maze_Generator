# Maze_Generator

A maze can be generated using a predetermined grid or arrangement of cells, 
which can be looked at as a connected graph. Each node of the graph 
represents a cell in the maze and the edges represent wall sites. Then, using the 
maze generating algorithm, a subgraph can be generated that represents a 
challenging route between 2 nodes.

### Algorithm

Randomized Primâ€™s Algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Start with a grid full of walls
2. Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the walls of the cell to the 
walls of the list
3. While there are walls in the list:
 1. Pick a random wall from the list. If only one of the two cells that the 
wall divides are visited, then:
 a) Make the wall a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of 
the maze
 b) Add the neighboring walls of the cell to the wall list.
 2. Remove the wall from the list
